# TCP Client Example

This repository contains a Python TCP client that demonstrates how to establish and manage a TCP socket connection for efficient data communication with a server. The client is built using the `TCPlient` class designed by [Phan Khac Hai]([https://khphan.com](https://khphan.com/2023/08/25/building-a-tcp-client-for-seamless-data-communication-a-python-example/).

## Features

- Easy-to-use `TCPlient` class for managing socket connections.
- Example main program demonstrating how to use the TCP client for data communication.
- Ensures reliable and orderly exchange of information using TCP.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `TCPsocket.py` file to see the implementation of the `TCPlient` class.
3. Modify the main program in `main.py` to suit your needs and server configuration.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
3. Run the main program using the command: `python main.py`.
